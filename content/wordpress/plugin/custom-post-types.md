# Custom Post Types

If you used custom post types in your theme, you will be asked to enable Custom Post Types (Udesly > Custom Post Types). For each custom post type you can configure few settings:

<div align="center">
  <g-image src="~/assets/images/udesly-cpt-plugin.png" />
</div>

The first time you enable the custom post type, and every time you modify the option "Archive Permalink" (this is the permalink of your archive page), you have to *flush* permalinks, otherwise WordPress will not show the page. To flush permalinks you have simply to press on *Save*, following the path: Settings > Permalinks
