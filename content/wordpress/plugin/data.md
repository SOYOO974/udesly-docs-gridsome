# Webflow Data

In this section you can import pages and frontend editor data, besides being able to cancel the frontend editor cache.

<div align="center">

</div>

The **Theme Report** section could be very useful as it contains all the elements you have used and those that are missing

<div align="center">

</div>

## When you have to import data?

You have to import data anytime you created a new page in Webflow, and if you left the Frontend Editor as enabled, every time you add texts, images, etc.. 
Don't worry this operation doesn't overwrite any data!
