# Udesly Plugin

## I can't find the plugin in the WordPress repository

The plugin is not on the WordPress repository and is hosted on github for easier management. To install the plugin you just have to follow the notices you get on the top of your WordPress Dashboard

## I can't see any Text or Image on my Website

Most of the time (99.99999999%) this is due to the fact that you forgot to *Import* data for the frontend editor, from Udesly > Webflow Data

## My posts are not shown on the frontend

I've added all attributes and my posts are not shown on my site!! 

Always look at the notices on the top of your WordPress dashboard, did you created all the posts queries that you used in Webflow? The Adapter warns you if there is missing data in your WordPress cms!

## I'm writing my content in a post and is not showing

Double check that you are writing your content in the correct place, a lot of the time the *Dynamic Box* is mistaken for the actual content
