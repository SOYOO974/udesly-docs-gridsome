# Glossary

Here you can find a list of some of the most used terms, that you may be not familiar with

* **Handle**: Handle is the user friendly and URL valid name of anything in Shopify. Inside handle you can not use spaces, accented characters, special characters or uppercase characters. E.g (My Product Name > my-product-name)


* **Template page**: If you have a Shopify online store, then you can create webpages in your Shopify admin. Webpages contain information that rarely changes or that customers will reference often, like an "About Us" page or a "Contact Us" page. For each page you create in Shopify, you can choose the template.

* **Default page**: It's the default template for each page you create in Shopify, if not specified otherwise.

* **Collections**: You can group your products into collections to make it easier for customers to find them.
