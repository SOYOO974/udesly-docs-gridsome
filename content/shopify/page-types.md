# Page Types

One usage of the custom attributes is to define what kind of page you are creating. 

Shopify uses a very specific page structure to create a template, and you can create all the type of pages simply adding some custom attributes on the **body** element of your page.

<video autoplay="" muted="" playsinline="true" loop="">
 <source src="/assets/video/page-type.webm">
</video>

## Shopify Pages Structure

Shopify can be used with unlimited pages but you are forced to create some pages, that we will explain below. Without these pages the Adapter will not try to convert at all your template, not because he can't, but because Shopify will not allow you to upload the theme.

These pages below are **mandatory**, so never forget to create them (even blank üòâ):

* **Index**: for real? yeah index page is mandatory;
* **Cart**: Webflow Ecommerce uses only the mini cart flow, while in Shopify is mandatory to have a page where cart items are shown;
* **Blog**: Shopify forces you to create a blog page, we don't know but in Shopify only 2 CMS types exists: Article and Product, and you are forced to create pages for both of them. (And no! you can't create custom types for the CMS in Shopify!);
* **Default**: Shopify allows you to create pages from the dashboard, *Default* is the layout that is used by default when you create a new page in Shopify;
* **Collection**: Collection is the page that shows all product in a Collection;
* **Product**: Product is the page that shows the specific product;

Yeah the last 2 were pretty much provided (Shopify is only an eCommerce, so if you don't show products, why you want to use it?!) but better be clear! 

So how you can define a page? ü§î

You have to keep in mind only 1 attribute

It can be simply defined on Webflow adding the following attribute on the **Body** element:

<div align="center"><code>page</code> <code class="dynamic-value">page type</code></div>

Page type can have different values and below you will find a list of all pages divided per functionality.

## Blog Pages

There are only 2 pages to create for the Blog to work finely:

### Blog Page

This is the page where all articles of a Blog will be shown (Note that in Shopify you can have multiple Blogs! No categories though üòû)

This page can be defined using the following attribute on the Body element of your page:

<Attribute name="page" value="blog" />

### Article Page

This is the page where a single article is shown:

This page can be defined using the following attribute on the Body element of your page:

<Attribute name="page" value="article" />

### Alternative Templates

Since you can create multiple blogs you can create alternative templates both for Blogs and Articles, using respectively these attributes on Body:


<Attribute name="page" value="blog-template" />

and 

<Attribute name="page" value="article-template" />


The name of the template will be the name of the page you created in Webflow, and you will be able to select the template from each article/blog

</div>

## Static Pages

All the static page you create in Webflow will be converted as template page. They are not automatically created in Shopify, you have to create manually them from Shopify Dashboard being sure to use the same handle (slug) you used in Webflow. And also don't forget to select the correct template:

<div align="center">
  <g-image src="~/assets/images/shopify-template-picker.jpg" />
</div>

The template will have the same name you used in Webflow.

## Default Page

In Shopify you can create pages directly from the backend, by default they will get a page called *Default*, to define your Default page use the attribute:

<Attribute name="page" value="default" />


## Utility and Remove
Utility pages like 404, search, password, need no attributes at all. 

If you want to not convert a page just add the attribute on body:

<Attribute name="page" value="remove" />


***

*Note: attributes values should always been inserted as handle, hyphens instead of spaces and all in lowercase *

## Do's and don'ts

Probably you are now thinking, *I have to add an attribute on every page?!? Are you kidding me?* üôÉ

Well fortunately, this is not the case üòÄ

The *Adapter* is smart enough to understand automatically some of your pages. 
The Utility pages needs no attribute, so no attribute for Not Found, Password, and Search Page.

<div align="center">
  <g-image src="~/assets/images/utility-pages.jpg" />
</div>

The Ecommerce Pages needs no attributes and they are automatically used for WooCommerce:

<div align="center">
  <g-image src="~/assets/images/ecommerce-pages.png" />
</div>

*Products Template* is used as Product Page

*Categories Template* is used as Collection Page

Also some CMS Pages are automatically recognized without attributes

<div align="center">
  <g-image src="~/assets/images/cms-pages.png" />
</div>

*Posts Template* is used as Article page (This happens only if you create your collection in Webflow using Posts as plural name and Post as singular name)

All static pages are automatically converted as template pages (Generic Pages that will be created in Shopify)

<div align="center">
  <g-image src="~/assets/images/static-pages.png" />
</div>

## READ THIS

Once again you can't use custom types for the CMS, so don't create them in Webflow, you have no way to convert them in Shopify!

What you say about Checkout and Order Confirmation Pages?? They are removed! Shopify doesn't allow you to modify the checkout layout, you can only upload a css file and only if you Shopify Plus (299$+ per month üòê)
